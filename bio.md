* **Education**
  <br/>
I was born in [Kota, Rajasthan](https://kota.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/kota/en/home.html), a prominent educational hub known for its coaching institutes. I completed my schooling at [St. John's Senior Secondary School](http://www.stjohnsschoolkota.edu.in/) in Kota and subsequently earned a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons.) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Rajasthan University](https://www.uniraj.ac.in/) in Jaipur. I further pursued a Master of Technology degree in Communication Engineering at the [National Institute of Technology Karnataka Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Sumam S. David](https://sumam.nitk.ac.in/). My academic journey culminated in a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/), under the guidance of [Sumana Gupta](https://www.iitk.ac.in/sumana-gupta) and [K. S. Venkatesh](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/). 
* **Experience**
  <br/>
Professionally, I have taught at the [Modi Institute of Management and Technology](http://www.modiedukota.org/) in Kota and at [Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology](https://vjcet.org/#/) in Muvattupuzha, Kerala. Following this, I was appointed as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [Department of Electrical Engineering KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) in Belgium, working under [Matthew B. Blaschko](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~mblaschk/). My research during this period involved collaboration with the [FORD Innovation and Research Centre Germany](https://www.ford.de/) and [USA](https://www.ford.com/), where I designed a front suspension for the Mac-Pherson architecture and studied the behavior of massive stars in space. \
